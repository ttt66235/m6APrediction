Description: A user-friendly R package designed for predicting m6A methylation sites in RNA sequences. It supports both single-sample and batch (multiple-sample) prediction tasks, leveraging a trained machine learning model (e.g., randomForest). The package integrates multi-dimensional features including GC content, RNA type, RNA region, exon length, distance to junction, evolutionary conservation, and DNA 5-mer sequences—with the latter automatically encoded into factor-type features via an internal utility function. It outputs both predicted m6A methylation probabilities and binary classification statuses ("Positive" or "Negative") based on a user-defined threshold, enabling efficient and flexible analysis for researchers in epigenetic and RNA biology.
